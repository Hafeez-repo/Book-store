/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the online bookstore application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user-specific data (profiles, cart items, orders, wishlists) while allowing public read access to book data.
 * Administrative privileges are managed through a dedicated `roles_admin` collection.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles.  Only the authenticated user (or an admin) can access their own profile.
 * - /books/{bookId}: Stores book information.  Publicly readable.  Admin users can manage books.
 * - /users/{userId}/cartItems/{cartItemId}: Stores cart items for a user. Only the authenticated user (or an admin) can manage their own cart.
 * - /users/{userId}/wishlistItems/{wishlistItemId}: Stores wishlist items for a user. Only the authenticated user can manage their own wishlist.
 * - /users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}: Stores order information for a user. Only the authenticated user (or an admin) can access their own orders.
 * - /books/{bookId}/reviews/{reviewId}: Stores reviews for a specific book. Includes denormalized 'userId' for authorization.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: If a document exists here for a user id, they are an admin.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User profiles and associated data (cart items, orders, wishlists) are strictly user-owned.
 * - Book data is publicly readable.
 * - Reviews are associated with both a book and a user, enabling moderation and personalized experiences.
 * - Listing of user profiles is disallowed.
 * - Only admins can create, update, and delete books.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - User roles are denormalized using the `/roles_admin/{userId}` collection to determine if a user has administrative privileges.
 * - Reviews are denormalized with the `userId` of the reviewer to enable ownership checks.
